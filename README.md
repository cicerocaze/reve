## Installing Rêve

### 1 - Install Perl environment

Equally to Dancer Framework, depending on the operating system, Rêve needs to have the Perl environment setted to be deployed. For Windows users, there some environments used, like: Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/), Dwimperl (http://dwimperl.com/) or ActivePerl (https://www.activestate.com/activeperl).

For Unix (Mac or Linux) users, Perl is a native language. This way, it is not necessary to install Perl compiler or any environment.

### 2 - Install Dancer framework

For both type of Operational Systems, it will be necessary to install Dancer framework. To do it, use CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network). CPAN is a great set of modules and a module mananger application. It is installed with one of the environments mentioned above (Strawberry, Dwinperl or Activeperl). Once the environment is installed, use the commands "cpan install Dancer2" in the terminal to install Dancer2 framework. Se the example:

    $ cpan install Dancer2

The Perl Dancer2 framework will be downloaded and installed, and with it, lots of mandatory modules are installed too.
